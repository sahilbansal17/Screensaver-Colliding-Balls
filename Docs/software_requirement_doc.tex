We plan to implement the following additional features:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Whenever any two balls collide, or a ball collides with the wall, their color should be changed for that instant of time to highlight the collision.
	\item In the GUI, the average no. of collisions taking place per second should be displayed.
	\item A ball could be selected with a mouse click and then its color should become white.
	\item To change the speed of the selected ball, a slider should be displayed, which will get updated with the current speed of ball when it is selected, and it can be adjusted to change the ball speed. 
\end{itemize}
